The current president, legal scholar Michael H. Schill, succeeded Morton O. Schapiro in fall 2022.[65] The president maintains a staff of vice presidents, directors, and other assistants for administrative, financial, faculty, and student matters.[66] Kathleen Haggerty assumed the role of provost for the university on September 1, 2020.[67]\\n\\nStudents are formally involved in the university's administration through the Associated Student Government, elected representatives of the undergraduate students, and the Graduate Student Association, which represents the university's graduate students.[68][69]\\n\\nThe admission requirements, degree requirements, courses of study, and disciplinary and degree recommendations for each of Northwestern's 12 schools are determined by the voting members of that school's faculty (assistant professor and above).[70]\\n\\nEndowment\\nNorthwestern maintains an endowment of $16.1 billion, the eighth-largest university endowment among private universities in the United States.[71] The endowment is sustained through donations and is maintained by investment advisers at the university's Investment Office.[72]\\n\\nSustainability\\n\\nStudents sailing along the shores of Northwestern University. The Chicago skyline can be seen from background.\\nIn January 2009, the Green Power Partnership (sponsored by the EPA) listed Northwestern as one of the top 10 universities in the country in purchasing energy from renewable sources[citation needed] The university matches 74 million kilowatt-hours (kWh) of its annual energy use with Green-e Certified Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs). This green power commitment represents 30 percent of the university's total annual electricity use and places Northwestern in the EPA's Green Power Leadership Club. The Initiative for Sustainability and Energy at Northwestern (ISEN), supporting research, teaching, and outreach in these themes, was launched in 2008.[73]\\n\\nNorthwestern requires that all new buildings be LEED-certified. Silverman Hall on the Evanston campus was awarded Gold LEED Certification in 2010; Wieboldt Hall on the Chicago campus was awarded Gold LEED Certification in 2007, and the Ford Motor Company Engineering Design Center on the Evanston campus was awarded Silver LEED Certification in 2006. New construction and renovation projects will be designed to provide at least a 20% improvement over energy code requirements where feasible.[74] At the beginning of the 2008–09 academic year, the university also released the Evanston Campus Framework Plan, which outlines plans for future development of the university's Evanston campus. The plan not only emphasizes sustainable building construction but also focuses on reducing the energy costs of transportation by optimizing pedestrian and bicycle access.[75] Northwestern has had a comprehensive recycling program in place since 1990. The university recycles over 1,500 tons of waste, or 30% of all waste produced on campus, each year. All landscape waste at the university is composted.[73]\", \"Evanston\\nNorthwestern University's main campus is located in the suburb of Evanston, Illinois, just north of Chicago. The campus spans an area of 240 acres and is characterized by its blend of modern and historic gothic architecture.\\n\\nNorthwestern's Evanston campus, where the undergraduate schools, the Graduate School, and the Kellogg School of Management are located, runs north–south from Lincoln Avenue to Clark Street west of Lake Michigan along Sheridan Road. North Campus is home to the fraternity quads, athletics facilities including the Henry Crown Sports Pavilion and Norris Aquatics Center, the Technological Institute, Dearborn Observatory, the Patrick G. and Shirley W. Ryan Hall for Nanofabrication and Molecular Self-Assembly, and the Ford Motor Company Engineering Design Center among others. South Campus is home to the university's humanities buildings, music buildings like the Pick-Staiger Concert Hall, the Mary and Leigh Block Museum of Art, and the sorority quads. In the 1960s, the university created an additional 84 acres (34 ha) for the campus by filling in a portion of Lake Michigan. Buildings located on the resulting Lakefill include University Library, the Patrick G. and Shirley W. Ryan Center for the Musical Arts, the Regenstein Hall of Music, Norris University Center (the student union), the Kellogg School of Management Global Hub, and various athletics facilities.\\n\\nThe Chicago Transit Authority's elevated train running through Evanston is called the Purple Line, taking its name from Northwestern's school color. The Foster and Davis stations are within walking distance of the southern end of the campus, while the Noyes station is close to the northern end of the campus. The Central station is close to Ryan Field, Northwestern's football stadium. The Evanston Davis Street Metra station serves the Northwestern campus in downtown Evanston and the Evanston Central Street Metra station is near Ryan Field. Pace Suburban Bus Service and the CTA have several bus routes that run through or near the Evanston campus.\\n\\nChicago\\n\\nThe Montgomery Ward Memorial Building (1927) at Northwestern's Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, America's first academic skyscraper[46]\\nNorthwestern's Chicago campus is located in the city's Streeterville neighborhood near Lake Michigan. The Chicago campus is home to the nationally ranked Northwestern Memorial Hospital, the medical school, the law school, the part-time MBA program, and the School of Professional Studies. Medill's one-year graduate program rents a floor on Wacker Drive, across the river from Streeterville and separate from the rest of the campus. Northwestern's professional schools and a number of its affiliated hospitals are located approximately four blocks east of the Chicago station on the CTA Red Line. The Chicago campus is also served by CTA bus routes.\\n\\nFounded at varying points in the university's history, the professional schools originally were scattered throughout Chicago.[47] In connection with a 1917 master plan for a central Chicago campus and President Walter Dill Scott's capital campaign, 8.5 acres (3.44 ha) of land were purchased at the corner of Chicago Avenue and Lake Shore Drive for $1.5 million in 1920.[47][48] Architect James Gamble Rogers was commissioned to create a master plan for the principal buildings on the new campus, which he designed in collegiate gothic style. In 1923, Mrs. Montgomery Ward donated $8 million to the campaign to finance the construction of the Montgomery Ward Memorial Building, which would house the medical and dental schools, and create endowments for faculty chairs, research grants, scholarships, and building maintenance.[49] The building would become the first university skyscraper in the United States.[46] In addition to the Ward Building, Rogers designed Wieboldt Hall to house facilities for the School of Commerce[50] and Levy Mayer Hall to house the School of Law.[51] The new campus comprising these three new buildings was dedicated during a two-day ceremony in June 1927. The Chicago campus continued to expand with the addition of Thorne Hall in 1931 and Abbott Hall in 1939.[47][52] In October 2013, Northwestern began the demolition of the architecturally significant Prentice Women's Hospital. Eric G. Neilson, dean of the medical school, penned an op-ed that equated retaining the building with loss of life.[53]\\n\\n\\nThe entrance of Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law's Levy Mayer Hall on the Chicago campus\\nEducation City\\nMain article: Northwestern University in Qatar\\nIn Fall 2008, Northwestern opened a campus in Education City, Doha, Qatar, joining five other American universities: Carnegie Mellon University, Cornell University, Georgetown University, Texas A&M University, and Virginia Commonwealth University.[54] Through the Medill School of Journalism and School of Communication, NU-Q offers bachelor's degrees in journalism and communications respectively.[55] However, some have questioned whether NU-Q can truly offer a comparable journalism program to that of its U.S. campus given Qatar's instances of censorship and strict limits on journalistic and academic freedoms.[56][57] The Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development, a private charitable institution founded by former emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani and his wife and mother of the current emir Sheikha Moza bint Nasser, provided funding for construction and administrative costs, as well as support to hire 50 to 60 faculty and staff, some of whom rotate between the Evanston and Qatar campuses.[58][59] Northwestern receives roughly $45 million per year to operate the campus.[57] In February 2016, Northwestern reached an agreement with the Qatar Foundation to extend the operations of the NU-Q branch for an additional decade, through the 2027–2028 academic year.[60] Like other universities with campuses in Doha, Northwestern has received criticism for accepting money from a country with a poor human rights record.[57][61][62]\\n\\n\", 'Northwestern University\\'s admissions are characterized as \"most selective\" by U.S. News & World Report.[78] Northwestern received a record 52,225 applications for its class size of approximately 2,100 students in 2022-2023 academic year. For the Class of 2027, regular decision acceptance rate was approximately 4.6%, while overall acceptance rate remained around 7.0%.[79] For the Class of 2026, the interquartile range (middle 50%) on the post-2016 SAT was a combined (verbal and math) 1500-1560 out of 1600; the interquartile range on the evidence-based reading and writing (EBRW) section of the SAT was 730-770 out of 800 while the interquartile range on the Math section of the SAT was 760-800 out of 800.[80] ACT composite scores for the middle 50% ranged from 33 to 35 out of 36, and 96% ranked in the top ten percent of their respective high school classes.[79][81][80]\\n\\nApproximately 35-40% percent of the incoming students of the Class of 2027 have been admitted through the Early Decision application round. Northwestern\\'s early decision admission numbers for the Class of 2027 reveal an early acceptance rate of about 20%, with approximately 1,000 students being admitted out of 5,220 applications.[82]\\n\\nIn April 2016, Northwestern became one of 15 Illinois universities to sign on to the Chicago Star Partnership, a City Colleges initiative aimed at increasing opportunities for students in the city\\'s public school district. Through this partnership, the university provides scholarships to students who \"graduate from Chicago Public Schools, get their associate degree from one of the city\\'s community colleges, and then get admitted to a bachelor\\'s degree program.\"[83]\\n\\nThe university is need-blind for domestic applicants.[84]\\n\\nRankings and reputation\\nAcademic rankings\\nNational\\nARWU[85]\\t20\\nForbes[86]\\t18\\nTHE / WSJ[87]\\t9\\nU.S. News & World Report[88]\\t9\\nWashington Monthly[89]\\t30\\nGlobal\\nARWU[90]\\t30\\nQS[91]\\t47 (tied)\\nTHE[92]\\t26 (tied)\\nU.S. News & World Report[93]\\t24\\nNorthwestern is a large, residential research university,[94] and is frequently ranked among one of the top universities in the United States, based on criteria such as campus diversity, social mobility of graduates, the likelihood of paying off student loans, alumni giving rates, research spending, the number of articles published in journals of Nature and Science, and data within the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System and College Scorecard—two federal government databases, among many others.[citation needed]\\n\\nEducation\\nThe university provides instruction in over 200 formal academic concentrations, 124 undergraduate programs, and 145 graduate and professional programs,[95][96] including various dual degree programs.[97][98] Although there is no university-wide core curriculum, a foundation in the liberal arts and sciences, sometimes referred as distribution requirements, are required for all majors; individual degree requirements are set by the faculty of each school.[70] The university heavily emphasizes interdisciplinary learning, with 72% of undergrads combining two or more areas of study.[99] Northwestern\\'s full-time undergraduate and graduate programs operate on an approximately 10-week academic quarter system with the academic year beginning in late September and ending in early June. Under the regular academic calendar, each quarter contains a four-day Reading Period in between the end of classes and the beginning of finals.[100] Undergraduates typically take four courses each quarter and twelve courses in an academic year and[101] are required to complete at least twelve quarters on campus to graduate. Northwestern offers honors, accelerated, and joint degree programs in medicine, science, mathematics, engineering, and journalism.[102] The comprehensive doctoral graduate program has high coexistence with undergraduate programs.[94]\\n\\n\\nFord Motor Company Engineering Design Center\\nThe most popular and prominent majors at Northwestern in 2021 include communication, journalism, engineering, computer science, mathematics, statistics, biological sciences, physics, and chemistry.[97][103] It is also prominent in law and medicine. Northwestern is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission and the respective national professional organizations for chemistry, psychology, business, education, journalism, music, engineering, law, and medicine.[104] Northwestern conferred 2,190 bachelor\\'s degrees, 3,272 master\\'s degrees, 565 doctoral degrees, and 444 professional degrees in 2012–2013.[needs update] Since 1951, Northwestern has awarded 520[needs update] honorary degrees.[105][106] Northwestern also has chapters of academic honor societies such as Phi Beta Kappa (Alpha of Illinois), Eta Kappa Nu, Tau Beta Pi, Eta Sigma Phi (Beta Chapter),[107] Lambda Pi Eta,[108] and Alpha Sigma Lambda (Alpha Chapter).[109]\\n\\nNorthwestern maintains a student-to-faculty ratio of 6:1. 77% of the classes have less than 20 students while 5.5% of the classes have more than 50 students.[97]\\n\\nLibraries and museums\\nThe Northwestern library system consists of four libraries on the Evanston campus including the Main University Library, the Boas Mathematics Library, Mudd Library, and the original library building, Deering Library; three libraries on the Chicago campus; and the library affiliated with Garrett-Evangelical Theological Seminary.[110] Northwestern Libraries host a total of 8,198,268 printed or electronic volumes.[111] In addition, its libraries contain 229,198 maps, 211,127 audio files, 103,377 printed journals, 196,716 electronic journals, 91,334 movies or videos, 36,989 manuscripts, 4.6 million microforms, and almost 99,000 periodicals.[111] The University Library is the 14th-largest university library in North America based on total number of titles held.', 'In 1873 the Evanston College for Ladies merged with Northwestern, and Frances Willard, who later gained fame as a suffragette and as one of the founders of the Woman\\'s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU), became the school\\'s first dean of women (Willard Residential College, built in 1938, honors her name). Northwestern admitted its first female students in 1869, and the first woman graduated in 1874.[22] Northwestern fielded its first intercollegiate football team in 1882, later becoming a founding member of the Big Ten Conference. In the 1870s and 1880s, Northwestern affiliated itself with already existing schools of law, medicine, and dentistry in Chicago. Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law is the oldest law school in Chicago. As the university\\'s enrollments grew, these professional schools were integrated with the undergraduate college in Evanston; the result was a modern research university combining professional, graduate, and undergraduate programs, which gave equal weight to teaching and research.[23][24]\\n\\n20th century\\n\\nA postcard of Northwestern University from 1907\\nBy the turn of the century, Northwestern had grown in stature to become the third-largest university in the United States after Harvard University and the University of Michigan.[25] Under Walter Dill Scott\\'s presidency from 1920 to 1939, Northwestern began construction of an integrated campus in Chicago designed by James Gamble Rogers, noted for his design of the Yale University campus, to house the professional schools. In addition, James Gamble Rogers designed a library in accordance with the gothic architectural style on the Evanston campus in order to make use of the $1 million donated to the school after the death of Charles Deering. This library is named in memory of him and its design was inspired by Cambridge University\\'s King\\'s College Chapel. The university also established the Kellogg School of Management and built several prominent buildings on the Evanston campus, including Dyche Stadium, now named Ryan Field, and Deering Library among others. In the 1920s, Northwestern became one of the first six universities in the United States to establish a Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps (NROTC). In 1939, Northwestern hosted the first-ever NCAA Division I men\\'s basketball championship game in the original Patten Gymnasium, which was later demolished and relocated farther north, along with the Dearborn Observatory, to make room for the Technological Institute.\\n\\n\\nDeering Library, which is named in memory of Charles Deering\\nAfter the golden years of the 1920s, the Great Depression in the United States (1929–1941) had a severe impact on the university\\'s finances. Its annual income dropped 25 percent from $4.8 million in 1930–31 to $3.6 million in 1933–34. Investment income shrank, fewer people could pay full tuition, and annual giving from alumni and philanthropists fell from $870,000 in 1932 to a low of $331,000 in 1935. The university responded with two salary cuts of 10 percent each for all employees. It imposed hiring and building freezes and slashed appropriations for maintenance, books, and research. Having had a balanced budget in 1930–31, the university now faced deficits of roughly $100,000 for the next four years. Enrollments fell in most schools, with law and music suffering the biggest declines. However, the movement toward state certification of school teachers prompted Northwestern to start a new graduate program in education, thereby bringing in new students and much-needed income. In June 1933, Robert Maynard Hutchins, president of the University of Chicago, proposed a merger of the two universities, estimating annual savings of $1.7 million. The two presidents were enthusiastic, and the faculty liked the idea; many Northwestern alumni, however, opposed it, fearing the loss of their alma mater and its many traditions that distinguished Northwestern from Chicago. The medical school, for example, was oriented toward training practitioners, and alumni feared it would lose its mission if it were merged into the more research-oriented University of Chicago Medical School.[26] The merger plan was ultimately dropped. In 1935, the Deering family rescued the university budget with an unrestricted gift of $6 million, bringing the budget up to $5.4 million in 1938–39. This allowed many of the previous spending cuts to be restored, including half of the salary reductions.[27]\\n\\n\\nUniversity Hall (1869), the second building constructed on campus, and the oldest building still standing\\nLike other American research universities, Northwestern was transformed by World War II (1939–1945). Regular enrollment fell dramatically, but the school opened high-intensity, short-term programs that trained over 50,000 military personnel, including future president John F. Kennedy. Northwestern\\'s existing NROTC program proved to be a boon to the university as it trained over 36,000 sailors over the course of the war, which led Northwestern to be called the \"Annapolis of the Midwest.\"[28] Franklyn B. Snyder led the university from 1939 to 1949, and after the war, surging enrollments under the G.I. Bill drove the dramatic expansion of both campuses. In 1948, prominent anthropologist Melville J. Herskovits founded the Program of African Studies at Northwestern, the first center of its kind at an American academic institution.[29] J. Roscoe Miller\\'s tenure as president from 1949 to 1970 saw an expansion of the Evanston campus, with the construction of the Lakefill on Lake Michigan, growth of the faculty and new academic programs, and polarizing Vietnam-era student protests. In 1978, the first and second Unabomber attacks occurred at Northwestern University.[30] Relations between Evanston and Northwestern became strained throughout much of the post-war era because of episodes of disruptive student activism,[31] disputes over municipal zoning, building codes, and law enforcement,[32] as well as restrictions on the sale of alcohol near campus until 1972.[33][34] Northwestern\\'s exemption from state and municipal property-tax obligations under its original charter has historically been a source of town-and-gown tension.\\n\\nAlthough government support for universities declined in the 1970s and 1980s, President Arnold R. Weber was able to stabilize university finances, which led to a revitalization of its campuses. In 1996, Princess Diana visited Northwestern\\'s Evanston and Chicago campuses to raise money for the university hospital\\'s Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center at the invitation of then-President Bienen. Her visit raised a total of $1.5 million for cancer research.[35][36][37]\\n\\n21st century\\n\\nRecently renovated Alice Millar Chapel\\nAs admissions to colleges and universities grew increasingly competitive in the 1990s and 2000s, President Henry S. Bienen\\'s tenure saw an increase in the number and quality of undergraduate applicants, continued expansion of the facilities and faculty, and renewed athletic competitiveness. In 1999, Northwestern student journalists uncovered information exonerating Illinois death-row inmate Anthony Porter two days before his scheduled execution. The Innocence Project has since exonerated 10 more men.[38][39] On January 11, 2003, in a speech at Northwestern School of Law\\'s Lincoln Hall, then Governor of Illinois George Ryan announced that he would commute the sentences of more than 150 death-row inmates.[40]\\n\\nIn the 2010s, a five-year capital campaign resulted in a new music center, a replacement building for the business school, and a $270 million athletic complex.[41][42] In 2014, President Barack Obama delivered a seminal economics speech at the Evanston campus.[43] In 2015, Queen Máxima and King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands visited Northwestern to announce research collaborations between Northwestern and several Dutch institutions focused on the study of aging.[44] In 2021, an additional $480 million, the largest donation in the university\\'s history, was donated to Northwestern by the Ryan Family to be applied to research at the Kellogg School of Management and Feinberg School of Medicine, as well as for renovating Ryan Field.[45]\\n\\n', 'Northwestern University (NU) is a private research university in Evanston, Illinois, United States. Established in 1851 to serve the historic Northwest Territory, it is the oldest chartered university in Illinois. The university has its main campus along the shores of Lake Michigan in the Chicago metropolitan area.\\n\\nChartered by the Illinois General Assembly in 1851, Northwestern was initially affiliated with the Methodist Episcopal Church but later became non-sectarian. By 1900, the university was the third-largest university in the United States. Northwestern became a founding member of the Big Ten Conference in 1896 and joined the Association of American Universities in 1917.\\n\\nNorthwestern is composed of eleven undergraduate, graduate, and professional schools, which include the Kellogg School of Management, the Pritzker School of Law, the Feinberg School of Medicine, the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences, the Bienen School of Music, the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science, the Medill School of Journalism, the School of Communication, the School of Professional Studies, the School of Education and Social Policy, and The Graduate School. Northwestern has additional campuses in downtown Chicago, Coral Gables, San Francisco, Doha, and Washington, D.C. As of 2023, the university maintains an endowment of $14.1 billion, along with an annual budget of around $2.9 billion,[6][7] and research funding of over $1 billion.[8] The university\\'s intercollegiate athletic teams, collectively known as the Northwestern Wildcats, compete in the NCAA Division I Big Ten Conference, of which the university is a founding member.\\n\\nAs of September 2020, 33 Nobel Prize laureates and 2 Fields Medalists,[9] have been affiliated with Northwestern as alumni or faculty. In addition, Northwestern has been associated with 45 Pulitzer Prize winners, 23 National Medal of Science winners, 11 National Humanities Medal recipients, 23 MacArthur Fellows, 20 Rhodes Scholars,[10] and 28 Marshall Scholars. Northwestern alumni also include 10 living billionaires,[11] 2 U.S. Supreme Court Justices,[12][13] and 24 Olympic medalists.\\n\\n\\nAerial photograph of Northwestern University from Lake Michigan\\nHistory\\nMain article: History of Northwestern University\\nFounding and early years\\nThe foundation of Northwestern University can be traced to a meeting on May 31, 1850, of nine prominent Chicago businessmen, Methodist leaders, and attorneys who had formed the idea of establishing a university to serve what had been known from 1787 to 1803 as the Northwest Territory. On January 28, 1851, the Illinois General Assembly granted a charter to the Trustees of the North-Western University, making it the first chartered university in Illinois.[14][15] The school\\'s nine founders, all of whom were Methodists (three of them ministers), knelt in prayer and worship before launching their first organizational meeting.[16] Although they affiliated the university with the Methodist Episcopal Church, they favored a non-sectarian admissions policy, believing that Northwestern should serve all people in the newly developing territory by bettering the economy in Evanston.[17]\\n\\nJohn Evans, for whom Evanston is named, bought 379 acres (153 ha) of land along Lake Michigan in 1853, and Philo Judson developed plans for what would become the city of Evanston, Illinois. The first building, Old College, opened on November 5, 1855.[18] To raise funds for its construction, Northwestern sold $100 \"perpetual scholarships\" entitling the purchaser and his heirs to free tuition.[19][20] Another building, University Hall, was built in 1869 of the same Joliet limestone as the Chicago Water Tower, also built in 1869, one of the few buildings in the heart of Chicago to survive the Great Chicago Fire of 1871.[21]', \"Provost Kathleen Hagerty and Senior Associate Vice President for Finance Mandy Distel presented the Northwestern University’s 2022 Financial Report to the Northwestern University Faculty Senate at Wednesday’s meeting.\\n\\nNorthwestern Northwestern University's net assets decreased from more than $16 billion last fiscal year to $15.4 billion, according to Executive Vice President Craig Johnson’s letter in the report. However, the Northwestern University ended the fiscal year with positive operating performance of $138.7 million across its schools. \\n\\nFollowing the report, senators discussed the Northwestern University’s employment policies, salaries and other items related to the budget. \\n\\nHagerty said there are currently about 500 vacancies in staff positions, down from a peak of about 800. According to Senator and RTVF Prof. Kyle Henry, pre-COVID-19 vacancies were usually between 200 and 250 positions. He said one position in the RTVF department turned over twice in a year and that high turnover negatively affects the quality of research.\\n\\nThe Faculty Senate hosted a meeting with the Board of Trustees in November centered on hiring and retention. \\n\\nSenate President and Medill Prof. Ceci Rodgers told The Daily other jobs may offer incentives, such as better pay or the ability to work remotely, that a position at NU may not. According to a survey the Northwestern University issued to employees last March, salary was the most important reason employees left NU.\\n\\nRodgers said Wednesday’s meeting was an indication the Northwestern University has heard the demands and will make changes. However, she said there isn’t an instant solution. \\n\\n“It’s just really hard to just jump in and say, ‘Yes, we can just give everybody this money,’” she said.\\n\\nNorthwestern University President Michael Schill said it is difficult for the Northwestern University to adjust employee salaries based on the inflation rate. The annual inflation rate was 7.1% in 2022, according to the U.S. Labor Department. \\n\\nSchill said that there’s no school that’s keeping up with inflation right now.\\n\\nSchill added that Northwestern was giving particular attention to salaries, because of a letter the Organization of Women Faculty introduced in the October meeting.\\n\\nThe OWF sent the letter to Schill and Peter Barris, chair of the Board of Trustees, in October. They demanded the Northwestern University support its faculty better, particularly its female-identifying staff. The letter addressed the Northwestern University’s decision to try to maintain its budget — including firing staff and freezing salaries — rather than provide equitable salary raises and resources for its employees. The Northwestern University’s strategy disproportionately affected people already marginalized by their race and gender, the letter said.\\n\\n“We’re listening, and we are changing,” Schill said. “But you know, again, change may not be fast enough for everyone.”\\n\\nHe added that addressing salary concerns is one of the Northwestern University’s top priorities. \\n\\nKellogg Prof. Angela Lee said Hagerty and Distel’s report on the budget was useful. She said she enjoyed that members had the opportunity to ask the presenters clarifying questions. \\n\\n“We have different backgrounds and different understandings,” Lee said about trying to process the information.\\n\\nAt the meeting, Rodgers also announced the Northwestern University is currently building three gender-neutral bathrooms.\\n\\nThe bathrooms will be in Annie May Swift Hall, Ford Motor Company Engineering Design Center and Fisk Hall. A potential fourth in Norris Northwestern University Center is awaiting approval. \"]\n"

The current president, legal scholar Michael H . Schill, succeeded Morton O . Schapiro in fall 2022.[65] The president maintains a staff of vice presidents, directors, and other assistants for administrative, financial, faculty, and student matters.[66] Kathleen Haggerty assumed the role of provost for the university on September 1, 2020.[67]\\n\\nStudents are formally involved in the university's administration through the Associated Student Government, elected representatives of the undergraduate students, and the Graduate Student Association, which represents the university's graduate students.[68][69]\\n\\nThe admission requirements, degree requirements, courses of study, and disciplinary and degree recommendations for each of Northwestern's 12 schools are determined by the voting members of that school's faculty (assistant professor and above).[70]\\n\\nEndowment\\nNorthwestern maintains an endowment of $16.1 billion, the eighth-largest university endowment among private universities in the United States.[71] The endowment is sustained through donations and is maintained by investment advisers at the university's Investment Office.[72]\\n\\nSustainability\\n\\nStudents sailing along the shores of Northwestern University . The Chicago skyline can be seen from background . In January 2009, the Green Power Partnership (sponsored by the EPA) listed Northwestern as one of the top 10 universities in the country in purchasing energy from renewable sources[citation needed] The university matches 74 million kilowatt-hours (kWh) of its annual energy use with Green-e Certified Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) . This green power commitment represents 30 percent of the university's total annual electricity use and places Northwestern in the EPA's Green Power Leadership Club . The Initiative for Sustainability and Energy at Northwestern (ISEN), supporting research, teaching, and outreach in these themes, was launched in 2008.[73]\\n\\nNorthwestern requires that all new buildings be LEED-certified . Silverman Hall on the Evanston campus was awarded Gold LEED Certification in 2010; Wieboldt Hall on the Chicago campus was awarded Gold LEED Certification in 2007, and the Ford Motor Company Engineering Design Center on the Evanston campus was awarded Silver LEED Certification in 2006 . New construction and renovation projects will be designed to provide at least a 20% improvement over energy code requirements where feasible.[74] At the beginning of the 2008–09 academic year, the university also released the Evanston Campus Framework Plan, which outlines plans for future development of the university's Evanston campus . The plan not only emphasizes sustainable building construction but also focuses on reducing the energy costs of transportation by optimizing pedestrian and bicycle access.[75] Northwestern has had a comprehensive recycling program in place since 1990 . The university recycles over 1,500 tons of waste, or 30% of all waste produced on campus, each year . All landscape waste at the university is composted.[73]\", \"Evanston\\nNorthwestern University's main campus is located in the suburb of Evanston, Illinois, just north of Chicago . The campus spans an area of 240 acres and is characterized by its blend of modern and historic gothic architecture . \\nNorthwestern's Evanston campus, where the undergraduate schools, the Graduate School, and the Kellogg School of Management are located, runs north–south from Lincoln Avenue to Clark Street west of Lake Michigan along Sheridan Road . North Campus is home to the fraternity quads, athletics facilities including the Henry Crown Sports Pavilion and Norris Aquatics Center, the Technological Institute, Dearborn Observatory, the Patrick G . and Shirley W . Ryan Hall for Nanofabrication and Molecular Self-Assembly, and the Ford Motor Company Engineering Design Center among others . South Campus is home to the university's humanities buildings, music buildings like the Pick-Staiger Concert Hall, the Mary and Leigh Block Museum of Art, and the sorority quads . In the 1960s, the university created an additional 84 acres (34 ha) for the campus by filling in a portion of Lake Michigan . Buildings located on the resulting Lakefill include University Library, the Patrick G . and Shirley W . Ryan Center for the Musical Arts, the Regenstein Hall of Music, Norris University Center (the student union), the Kellogg School of Management Global Hub, and various athletics facilities . \\nThe Chicago Transit Authority's elevated train running through Evanston is called the Purple Line, taking its name from Northwestern's school color . The Foster and Davis stations are within walking distance of the southern end of the campus, while the Noyes station is close to the northern end of the campus\", \". The Central station is close to Ryan Field, Northwestern's football stadium . The Evanston Davis Street Metra station serves the Northwestern campus in downtown Evanston and the Evanston Central Street Metra station is near Ryan Field . Pace Suburban Bus Service and the CTA have several bus routes that run through or near the Evanston campus . \\nChicago\\n\\nThe Montgomery Ward Memorial Building (1927) at Northwestern's Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, America's first academic skyscraper[46]\\nNorthwestern's Chicago campus is located in the city's Streeterville neighborhood near Lake Michigan . The Chicago campus is home to the nationally ranked Northwestern Memorial Hospital, the medical school, the law school, the part-time MBA program, and the School of Professional Studies . Medill's one-year graduate program rents a floor on Wacker Drive, across the river from Streeterville and separate from the rest of the campus . Northwestern's professional schools and a number of its affiliated hospitals are located approximately four blocks east of the Chicago station on the CTA Red Line . The Chicago campus is also served by CTA bus routes . \\nFounded at varying points in the university's history, the professional schools originally were scattered throughout Chicago.[47] In connection with a 1917 master plan for a central Chicago campus and President Walter Dill Scott's capital campaign, 8.5 acres (3.44 ha) of land were purchased at the corner of Chicago Avenue and Lake Shore Drive for $1.5 million in 1920.[47][48] Architect James Gamble Rogers was commissioned to create a master plan for the principal buildings on the new campus, which he designed in collegiate gothic style . In 1923, Mrs . Montgomery Ward donated $8 million to the campaign to finance the construction of the Montgomery Ward Memorial Building, which would house the medical and dental schools, and create endowments for faculty chairs, research grants, scholarships, and building maintenance.[49] The building would become the first university skyscraper in the United States.[46] In addition to the Ward Building, Rogers designed Wieboldt Hall to house facilities for the School of Commerce[50] and Levy Mayer Hall to house the School of Law.[51] The new campus comprising these three new buildings was dedicated during a two-day ceremony in June 1927 . The Chicago campus continued to expand with the addition of Thorne Hall in 1931 and Abbott Hall in 1939.[47][52] In October 2013, Northwestern began the demolition of the architecturally significant Prentice Women's Hospital .\", \"Eric G . Neilson, dean of the medical school, penned an op-ed that equated retaining the building with loss of life.[53]\\n\\n\\nThe entrance of Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law's Levy Mayer Hall on the Chicago campus\\nEducation City\\nMain article: Northwestern University in Qatar\\nIn Fall 2008, Northwestern opened a campus in Education City, Doha, Qatar, joining five other American universities: Carnegie Mellon University, Cornell University, Georgetown University, Texas A&M University, and Virginia Commonwealth University.[54] Through the Medill School of Journalism and School of Communication, NU-Q offers bachelor's degrees in journalism and communications respectively.[55] However, some have questioned whether NU-Q can truly offer a comparable journalism program to that of its U.S . campus given Qatar's instances of censorship and strict limits on journalistic and academic freedoms.[56][57] The Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development, a private charitable institution founded by former emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani and his wife and mother of the current emir Sheikha Moza bint Nasser, provided funding for construction and administrative costs, as well as support to hire 50 to 60 faculty and staff, some of whom rotate between the Evanston and Qatar campuses.[58][59] Northwestern receives roughly $45 million per year to operate the campus.[57] In February 2016, Northwestern reached an agreement with the Qatar Foundation to extend the operations of the NU-Q branch for an additional decade, through the 2027–2028 academic year.[60] Like other universities with campuses in Doha, Northwestern has received criticism for accepting money from a country with a poor human rights record.[57][61][62]\\n\\n\", 'Northwestern University\\'s admissions are characterized as \"most selective\" by U.S . News & World Report.[78] Northwestern received a record 52,225 applications for its class size of approximately 2,100 students in 2022-2023 academic year . For the Class of 2027, regular decision acceptance rate was approximately 4.6%, while overall acceptance rate remained around 7.0%.[79] For the Class of 2026, the interquartile range (middle 50%) on the post-2016 SAT was a combined (verbal and math) 1500-1560 out of 1600; the interquartile range on the evidence-based reading and writing (EBRW) section of the SAT was 730-770 out of 800 while the interquartile range on the Math section of the SAT was 760-800 out of 800.[80] ACT composite scores for the middle 50% ranged from 33 to 35 out of 36, and 96% ranked in the top ten percent of their respective high school classes.[79][81][80]\\n\\nApproximately 35-40% percent of the incoming students of the Class of 2027 have been admitted through the Early Decision application round .

Under the regular academic calendar, each quarter contains a four-day Reading Period in between the end of classes and the beginning of finals.[100] Undergraduates typically take four courses each quarter and twelve courses in an academic year and[101] are required to complete at least twelve quarters on campus to graduate . Northwestern offers honors, accelerated, and joint degree programs in medicine, science, mathematics, engineering, and journalism.[102] The comprehensive doctoral graduate program has high coexistence with undergraduate programs.[94]\\n\\n\\nFord Motor Company Engineering Design Center\\nThe most popular and prominent majors at Northwestern in 2021 include communication, journalism, engineering, computer science, mathematics, statistics, biological sciences, physics, and chemistry.[97][103] It is also prominent in law and medicine . Northwestern is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission and the respective national professional organizations for chemistry, psychology, business, education, journalism, music, engineering, law, and medicine.[104] Northwestern conferred 2,190 bachelor\\'s degrees, 3,272 master\\'s degrees, 565 doctoral degrees, and 444 professional degrees in 2012–2013.[needs update] Since 1951, Northwestern has awarded 520[needs update] honorary degrees.[105][106] Northwestern also has chapters of academic honor societies such as Phi Beta Kappa (Alpha of Illinois), Eta Kappa Nu, Tau Beta Pi, Eta Sigma Phi (Beta Chapter),[107] Lambda Pi Eta,[108] and Alpha Sigma Lambda (Alpha Chapter).[109]\\n\\nNorthwestern maintains a student-to-faculty ratio of 6:1 . 77% of the classes have less than 20 students while 5.5% of the classes have more than 50 students.[97]\\n\\nLibraries and museums\\nThe Northwestern library system consists of four libraries on the Evanston campus including the Main University Library, the Boas Mathematics Library, Mudd Library, and the original library building, Deering Library; three libraries on the Chicago campus; and the library affiliated with Garrett-Evangelical Theological Seminary.[110] Northwestern Libraries host a total of 8,198,268 printed or electronic volumes.[111] In addition, its libraries contain 229,198 maps, 211,127 audio files, 103,377 printed journals, 196,716 electronic journals, 91,334 movies or videos, 36,989 manuscripts, 4.6 million microforms, and almost 99,000 periodicals.[111] The University Library is the 14th-largest university library in North America based on total number of titles held.', \"In 1873 the Evanston College for Ladies merged with Northwestern, and Frances Willard, who later gained fame as a suffragette and as one of the founders of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU), became the school's first dean of women (Willard Residential College, built in 1938, honors her name) . Northwestern admitted its first female students in 1869, and the first woman graduated in 1874.[22] Northwestern fielded its first intercollegiate football team in 1882, later becoming a founding member of the Big Ten Conference . In the 1870s and 1880s, Northwestern affiliated itself with already existing schools of law, medicine, and dentistry in Chicago . Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law is the oldest law school in Chicago . As the university's enrollments grew, these professional schools were integrated with the undergraduate college in Evanston; the result was a modern research university combining professional, graduate, and undergraduate programs, which gave equal weight to teaching and research.[23][24]\\n\\n20th century\\n\\nA postcard of Northwestern University from 1907\\nBy the turn of the century, Northwestern had grown in stature to become the third-largest university in the United States after Harvard University and the University of Michigan.[25] Under Walter Dill Scott's presidency from 1920 to 1939, Northwestern began construction of an integrated campus in Chicago designed by James Gamble Rogers, noted for his design of the Yale University campus, to house the professional schools . In addition, James Gamble Rogers designed a library in accordance with the gothic architectural style on the Evanston campus in order to make use of the $1 million donated to the school after the death of Charles Deering . This library is named in memory of him and its design was inspired by Cambridge University's King's College Chapel . The university also established the Kellogg School of Management and built several prominent buildings on the Evanston campus, including Dyche Stadium, now named Ryan Field, and Deering Library among others . In the 1920s, Northwestern became one of the first six universities in the United States to establish a Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps (NROTC) . In 1939, Northwestern hosted the first-ever NCAA Division I men's basketball championship game in the original Patten Gymnasium, which was later demolished and relocated farther north, along with the Dearborn Observatory, to make room for the Technological Institute . \\n\\nDeering Library, which is named in memory of Charles Deering\\nAfter the golden years of the 1920s, the Great Depression in the United States (1929–1941) had a severe impact on the university's finances . Its annual income dropped 25 percent from $4.8 million in 1930–31 to $3.6 million in 1933–34 . Investment income shrank, fewer people could pay full tuition, and annual giving from alumni and philanthropists fell from $870,000 in 1932 to a low of $331,000 in 1935\", '. The university responded with two salary cuts of 10 percent each for all employees . It imposed hiring and building freezes and slashed appropriations for maintenance, books, and research . Having had a balanced budget in 1930–31, the university now faced deficits of roughly $100,000 for the next four years . Enrollments fell in most schools, with law and music suffering the biggest declines . However, the movement toward state certification of school teachers prompted Northwestern to start a new graduate program in education, thereby bringing in new students and much-needed income . In June 1933, Robert Maynard Hutchins, president of the University of Chicago, proposed a merger of the two universities, estimating annual savings of $1.7 million . The two presidents were enthusiastic, and the faculty liked the idea; many Northwestern alumni, however, opposed it, fearing the loss of their alma mater and its many traditions that distinguished Northwestern from Chicago . The medical school, for example, was oriented toward training practitioners, and alumni feared it would lose its mission if it were merged into the more research-oriented University of Chicago Medical School.[26] The merger plan was ultimately dropped . In 1935, the Deering family rescued the university budget with an unrestricted gift of $6 million, bringing the budget up to $5.4 million in 1938–39 . This allowed many of the previous spending cuts to be restored, including half of the salary reductions.[27]\\n\\n\\nUniversity Hall (1869), the second building constructed on campus, and the oldest building still standing\\nLike other American research universities, Northwestern was transformed by World War II (1939–1945) . Regular enrollment fell dramatically, but the school opened high-intensity, short-term programs that trained over 50,000 military personnel, including future president John F . Kennedy .', 'Northwestern\\'s existing NROTC program proved to be a boon to the university as it trained over 36,000 sailors over the course of the war, which led Northwestern to be called the \"Annapolis of the Midwest.\"[28] Franklyn B . Snyder led the university from 1939 to 1949, and after the war, surging enrollments under the G.I . Bill drove the dramatic expansion of both campuses . In 1948, prominent anthropologist Melville J . Herskovits founded the Program of African Studies at Northwestern, the first center of its kind at an American academic institution.[29] J . Roscoe Miller\\'s tenure as president from 1949 to 1970 saw an expansion of the Evanston campus, with the construction of the Lakefill on Lake Michigan, growth of the faculty and new academic programs, and polarizing Vietnam-era student protests . In 1978, the first and second Unabomber attacks occurred at Northwestern University.[30] Relations between Evanston and Northwestern became strained throughout much of the post-war era because of episodes of disruptive student activism,[31] disputes over municipal zoning, building codes, and law enforcement,[32] as well as restrictions on the sale of alcohol near campus until 1972.[33][34] Northwestern\\'s exemption from state and municipal property-tax obligations under its original charter has historically been a source of town-and-gown tension . \\nAlthough government support for universities declined in the 1970s and 1980s, President Arnold R . Weber was able to stabilize university finances, which led to a revitalization of its campuses . In 1996, Princess Diana visited Northwestern\\'s Evanston and Chicago campuses to raise money for the university hospital\\'s Robert H . Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center at the invitation of then-President Bienen . Her visit raised a total of $1.5 million for cancer research.[35][36][37]\\n\\n21st century\\n\\nRecently renovated Alice Millar Chapel\\nAs admissions to colleges and universities grew increasingly competitive in the 1990s and 2000s, President Henry S . Bienen\\'s tenure saw an increase in the number and quality of undergraduate applicants, continued expansion of the facilities and faculty, and renewed athletic competitiveness', \". In 1999, Northwestern student journalists uncovered information exonerating Illinois death-row inmate Anthony Porter two days before his scheduled execution . The Innocence Project has since exonerated 10 more men.[38][39] On January 11, 2003, in a speech at Northwestern School of Law's Lincoln Hall, then Governor of Illinois George Ryan announced that he would commute the sentences of more than 150 death-row inmates.[40]\\n\\nIn the 2010s, a five-year capital campaign resulted in a new music center, a replacement building for the business school, and a $270 million athletic complex.[41][42] In 2014, President Barack Obama delivered a seminal economics speech at the Evanston campus.[43] In 2015, Queen Máxima and King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands visited Northwestern to announce research collaborations between Northwestern and several Dutch institutions focused on the study of aging.[44] In 2021, an additional $480 million, the largest donation in the university's history, was donated to Northwestern by the Ryan Family to be applied to research at the Kellogg School of Management and Feinberg School of Medicine, as well as for renovating Ryan Field.[45]\\n\\n\", \"Northwestern University (NU) is a private research university in Evanston, Illinois, United States . Established in 1851 to serve the historic Northwest Territory, it is the oldest chartered university in Illinois . The university has its main campus along the shores of Lake Michigan in the Chicago metropolitan area . \\nChartered by the Illinois General Assembly in 1851, Northwestern was initially affiliated with the Methodist Episcopal Church but later became non-sectarian . By 1900, the university was the third-largest university in the United States . Northwestern became a founding member of the Big Ten Conference in 1896 and joined the Association of American Universities in 1917 . \\nNorthwestern is composed of eleven undergraduate, graduate, and professional schools, which include the Kellogg School of Management, the Pritzker School of Law, the Feinberg School of Medicine, the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences, the Bienen School of Music, the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science, the Medill School of Journalism, the School of Communication, the School of Professional Studies, the School of Education and Social Policy, and The Graduate School . Northwestern has additional campuses in downtown Chicago, Coral Gables, San Francisco, Doha, and Washington, D.C . As of 2023, the university maintains an endowment of $14.1 billion, along with an annual budget of around $2.9 billion,[6][7] and research funding of over $1 billion.[8] The university's intercollegiate athletic teams, collectively known as the Northwestern Wildcats, compete in the NCAA Division I Big Ten Conference, of which the university is a founding member . \\nAs of September 2020, 33 Nobel Prize laureates and 2 Fields Medalists,[9] have been affiliated with Northwestern as alumni or faculty . In addition, Northwestern has been associated with 45 Pulitzer Prize winners, 23 National Medal of Science winners, 11 National Humanities Medal recipients, 23 MacArthur Fellows, 20 Rhodes Scholars,[10] and 28 Marshall Scholars . Northwestern alumni also include 10 living billionaires,[11] 2 U.S . Supreme Court Justices,[12][13] and 24 Olympic medalists\", '. \\n\\nAerial photograph of Northwestern University from Lake Michigan\\nHistory\\nMain article: History of Northwestern University\\nFounding and early years\\nThe foundation of Northwestern University can be traced to a meeting on May 31, 1850, of nine prominent Chicago businessmen, Methodist leaders, and attorneys who had formed the idea of establishing a university to serve what had been known from 1787 to 1803 as the Northwest Territory . On January 28, 1851, the Illinois General Assembly granted a charter to the Trustees of the North-Western University, making it the first chartered university in Illinois.[14][15] The school\\'s nine founders, all of whom were Methodists (three of them ministers), knelt in prayer and worship before launching their first organizational meeting.[16] Although they affiliated the university with the Methodist Episcopal Church, they favored a non-sectarian admissions policy, believing that Northwestern should serve all people in the newly developing territory by bettering the economy in Evanston.[17]\\n\\nJohn Evans, for whom Evanston is named, bought 379 acres (153 ha) of land along Lake Michigan in 1853, and Philo Judson developed plans for what would become the city of Evanston, Illinois . The first building, Old College, opened on November 5, 1855.[18] To raise funds for its construction, Northwestern sold $100 \"perpetual scholarships\" entitling the purchaser and his heirs to free tuition.[19][20] Another building, University Hall, was built in 1869 of the same Joliet limestone as the Chicago Water Tower, also built in 1869, one of the few buildings in the heart of Chicago to survive the Great Chicago Fire of 1871.[21]', \"Provost Kathleen Hagerty and Senior Associate Vice President for Finance Mandy Distel presented the Northwestern University’s 2022 Financial Report to the Northwestern University Faculty Senate at Wednesday’s meeting . \\nNorthwestern Northwestern University's net assets decreased from more than $16 billion last fiscal year to $15.4 billion, according to Executive Vice President Craig Johnson’s letter in the report . However, the Northwestern University ended the fiscal year with positive operating performance of $138.7 million across its schools . \\n\\nFollowing the report, senators discussed the Northwestern University’s employment policies, salaries and other items related to the budget . \\n\\nHagerty said there are currently about 500 vacancies in staff positions, down from a peak of about 800 . According to Senator and RTVF Prof . Kyle Henry, pre-COVID-19 vacancies were usually between 200 and 250 positions . He said one position in the RTVF department turned over twice in a year and that high turnover negatively affects the quality of research . \\nThe Faculty Senate hosted a meeting with the Board of Trustees in November centered on hiring and retention . \\n\\nSenate President and Medill Prof . Ceci Rodgers told The Daily other jobs may offer incentives, such as better pay or the ability to work remotely, that a position at NU may not . According to a survey the Northwestern University issued to employees last March, salary was the most important reason employees left NU . \\nRodgers said Wednesday’s meeting was an indication the Northwestern University has heard the demands and will make changes\", '. However, she said there isn’t an instant solution . \\n\\n“It’s just really hard to just jump in and say, ‘Yes, we can just give everybody this money,’” she said . \\nNorthwestern University President Michael Schill said it is difficult for the Northwestern University to adjust employee salaries based on the inflation rate . The annual inflation rate was 7.1% in 2022, according to the U.S . Labor Department . \\n\\nSchill said that there’s no school that’s keeping up with inflation right now . \\nSchill added that Northwestern was giving particular attention to salaries, because of a letter the Organization of Women Faculty introduced in the October meeting . \\nThe OWF sent the letter to Schill and Peter Barris, chair of the Board of Trustees, in October . They demanded the Northwestern University support its faculty better, particularly its female-identifying staff . The letter addressed the Northwestern University’s decision to try to maintain its budget — including firing staff and freezing salaries — rather than provide equitable salary raises and resources for its employees . The Northwestern University’s strategy disproportionately affected people already marginalized by their race and gender, the letter said . \\n“We’re listening, and we are changing,” Schill said .', '“But you know, again, change may not be fast enough for everyone.”\\n\\nHe added that addressing salary concerns is one of the Northwestern University’s top priorities . \\n\\nKellogg Prof . Angela Lee said Hagerty and Distel’s report on the budget was useful . She said she enjoyed that members had the opportunity to ask the presenters clarifying questions . \\n\\n“We have different backgrounds and different understandings,” Lee said about trying to process the information . \\nAt the meeting, Rodgers also announced the Northwestern University is currently building three gender-neutral bathrooms . \\nThe bathrooms will be in Annie May Swift Hall, Ford Motor Company Engineering Design Center and Fisk Hall . A potential fourth in Norris Northwestern University Center is awaiting approval . ']\n",
